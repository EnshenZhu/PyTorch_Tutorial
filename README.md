## About PyTorch

PyTorch is a machine learning framework, and it specifically works on Deep Learning.

## Chapter 0: PyTorch and Deep Learning Fundamentals

### What is deep learning?

* It is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the
  **human brain**.
* Artificial Intelligence > Machine Learning > Deep Learning

### Traditional Programming vs ML Algorithm

* Traditional Programming: Inputs+Rules --> Output
* ML Algorithm: Input+Output --> Find the rule

### Why use machine learning (or deep learning)?

* For a complex problem, it is challenging to think of all the rules by humans' brain.
  Therefore, we can ask the computer to think about it.

### What deep learning is good for?

* **Problems with long lists of rules** --> when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep learning may
  help.
