## Chapter 0: PyTorch and Deep Learning Fundamentals

### What is deep learning?

* It is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the
  **human brain**.
* Artificial Intelligence > Machine Learning > Deep Learning

### Traditional Programming vs ML Algorithm

* Traditional Programming: Inputs+Rules --> Output
* ML Algorithm: Input+Output --> Find the rule
